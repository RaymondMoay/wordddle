## What is it

My take on Wordle. The twist is the addition of levels. Every level introduces a new word with +1 number of letters (tries remain the same at 6x). Just like wordle, it refreshes daily.

## Tech stack

Super simple tech stack and really just a react UI exercise here. A sunday-fun-day coding exercise. The site will be statically generated with regeneration happening every day to download the latest word levels.

- NextJS + React + Typescript
- Google Sheets API (My super basic CMS to manually key in words... for now)
- Vercel
