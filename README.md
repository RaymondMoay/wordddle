## What is it

My take on Wordle. The twist is (1) the addition of levels and (2) hints.

Every level introduces a new word with +1 number of letters (tries remain the same at 6x). Just like wordle, it refreshes daily. Users can get 1 hint per word at the expense of 1 additional try.

## Tech stack

Super simple tech stack and really just a react UI exercise here. A sunday-fun-day coding exercise. The site will be statically generated with regeneration happening every day to download the latest word levels.

- NextJS + React + Typescript
- Google Sheets API (My super basic CMS to manually key in words... for now)
- Vercel
- Tailwind
